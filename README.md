# Hey Nate, Thanks for taking the time to read this!
[![Python Continuous Integration](https://github.com/afeins19/TestingAndCIDemo/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/afeins19/TestingAndCIDemo/actions/workflows/main.yml)

I wanted to help you check your (Awesome) CMPSC 131/132 students work with the use of continuous integration and automated testing. 

The Latest Github CI Workflow should execute (and pass hopefully) for python version 3.9 whenever something is pushed to this repository, 

Also, I'm going to Human Robot some time next week and im pretty sure you were talking about it to me. Could you recommend me a solid beer to order (not an IPA) so i dont look dumb in front of my friends :)

Thanks Aaron.
