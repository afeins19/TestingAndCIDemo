# Hey Nate, Thanks for taking the time to read this!

I wanted to help you check your (Awesome) CMPSC 131/132 students work with the use of continuous integration and automated testing. Also, I'm going to Human Robot some time next week and im pretty sure you mentioned it to me, could you recommend me a solid beer to order (not an IPA) so i dont look dumb in front of my friends. 

Thank's Aaron.
